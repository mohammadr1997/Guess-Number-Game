## Guess-Number-Game

>> the ***Second Project*** has been added.I used DOM to know how it works and practice it to produce this game. I did on my own and the idea of such a game came to my mind when i was searching about different kind of games we can make with javascript. I got this point that javascript is so broad and it needs lots of time concentration to get mastery over it
